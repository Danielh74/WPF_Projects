Hello and welcome to my final WPF project!
The first thing you'll see when you open my project is the hope page which is where you can access all of my projects and a section about me.
first of all if you click on my profile picture in the upper left corner of the app you will go to the page about me and my contact information.
other than that if you click the picture again from any other page you will go back to the home screen, my "Project Gallery".
There you can see 8 of my projects- 6 main ones and 2 extra that I did.
If you'll click the projects icons you will go to the page that explain a little aout the app but more inviting you in.
The first project you'll see (from left to right) is:

1. TicTacToe game, which is preaty simple, it's a normal TicTacToe game where you have a grid and you need to place the X in a straight line or a diagnle line to win 
   however in my app you can play against a human player and write your names so you can track your scores, play agains the computer or watch the computer play 
   against itself and as I mantion there is a leadernoard to track the scores.

2. Memory card game which is pokemon themed. there you have the options to select the number of cards you want to play- 12, 16 or 20 cards.
   and you also have a score board to track each player score, however in this game you can only play agains a human player.

3. Pokedex app where when you enter the app you will be greeted to a dropbox with every pokemon ever and a button to view the stats of the pokemon.
   there you will see the pokemon's basic stats, its abilities, its evolutions, height, weight, types and its learnable moves.

4. Photo gallery app where you first need to register with an email and a password and than you will be greeted to a screen where you can add, view and favorite 
   photos and watch them whenever you'd like!. (For a quick access and demo of the app - my email is 1 and password is 1).
   Of course when other people want to register they will have to enter a valid email format and a password with at least 8 characters with numbers and letters.

5. Uno card game- I couldnt find TAKI assets online so I got made an Uno gamw which is american Taki assentially.
   There you can choose to play 2-4 players (1 human and the rest com players) and play Uno with all of its rules!

6. Pong - the classic pong game where you have 2 paddles and need to not let the ball hit your side of the screen.
   the game can be played only by 2 human players, one control with WASD and the other control with the arrow keys.

   Now for the extra projects:

 1. Employee manager app- in this app you will have a Data table with information for your employees (ID, Name, Age and Department).
    In this app you can easily add, edit and delete your employees with just a click of a button, to edit press the edit button next to the specific employee you       want to edit, thir info will be displayed in the textboxes on the right side of the screen and you can edit them from there, to clear the texboxes press the        clear button below, to delete employees press the delete button next to the specific employee and confirm your action and to add just fill the information 
    and press the add button.

    2. Joke app- there you will have only one button to generate a joke from an API but if you wantg you can change the settings of the jokes that will generate by        pressing the settings (gear) button in the upper right corner and choose the setting you'd like in the joke.
   
 That's it, I hope you will like and find my projects interesting
